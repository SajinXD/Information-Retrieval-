Climate Change Emergency and Global Warming Projections

Scientists worldwide warn that more than seventy-five percent of Earth's critical boundaries have been breached. The 2025 Planetary Health Check report found seven of nine planetary boundaries are in danger due to human activities. Ocean acidification has become the newest boundary broken joining climate change biosphere integrity and biogeochemical flows on the list of exceeded limits.

A UN Environment Programme assessment finds that global warming projections based on full implementation of Nationally Determined Contributions are now 2.3 to 2.5 degrees Celsius compared to 2.6 to 2.8 degrees in last year's report. Implementing only current policies would lead to up to 2.8 degrees of warming. However methodological updates account for one tenth of a degree of the improvement and the upcoming US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement threatens to cancel another tenth of a degree.

Climate change is already fueling a global health emergency killing more than half a million people annually through extreme heat events. Floods heatwaves droughts and storms force millions from their homes every year. Most displaced persons remain within national borders but are still uprooted from their communities. The strongest typhoon to make landfall in the Philippines this year impacted 1.7 million children and more than five million people overall.

Despite challenges renewable energy is expanding rapidly. Solar and wind deployment costs continue falling making clean energy increasingly economical even with ongoing fossil fuel subsidies. However fossil fuels still account for eighty-one percent of the global energy system the same percentage as thirty years ago. Wind and solar energy consumption have been rising rapidly but still lag far behind fossil fuel consumption.

Scientists estimate fossil fuel subsidies at seven trillion dollars in 2022 when unpriced externalities are accounted for. Some researchers argue there is a need for grassroots social movements that advocate for a just fossil fuel phaseout and limits on the fossil fuel industry's financial and political influence. A fossil fuel phaseout would also help to reduce emissions of methane a potent greenhouse gas.

The 2025 Central Canada Fires underscore national challenges of a warming climate and cascading international impacts. Amazon rainforest deforestation declined under strengthened environmental enforcement but the region experienced a significant surge in fires due to severe drought conditions. These fires which are not always classified as deforestation have raised concerns about ongoing ecosystem degradation.

NOAA's April 2025 US Climate Report documented a slow-moving storm system that brought over 150 tornadoes to the South and Midwest resulting in at least 24 fatalities and widespread flooding. This event underscores the increasing frequency of severe convective storms in a warming climate. Urgent action is needed to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy sources and protect vulnerable ecosystems from irreversible damage.
